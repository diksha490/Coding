Check if X can give change to every person in the Queue

Given an array of N integers where Ai denotes the currency of note that the i-th person has. The possible currencies are 5, 10 and 20.
 All the N people are standing in a queue waiting to buy an ice-cream from X which costs Rs 5. Initially, X has an initial balance of 0. 
 Check if X will be able to provide change to every people who are waiting to buy an ice-cream.

Examples:

Input:a[] = {5, 5, 5, 10, 20}
Output: YES
When the fourth person chance comes to buy an ice-cream, X has three Rs 5
change, hence X gives him 1, and now when the fifth person
comes to buy the ice-cream, X has two Rs 5 and one Rs 10 note, hence he
gives him one Rs 10 and one Rs 5 note.

Input: a[] = {5, 10, 10, 20}
Output: NO
